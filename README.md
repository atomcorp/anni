# Anni Albers-style designs in JavaScript!

This project is inspired by the amazing works I saw recently in the [Tate Modern Anni Albers exhibition](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/anni-albers). The aim is to make dynamically generated versions in the style of her prints like [TR II, 1970](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/68501).
